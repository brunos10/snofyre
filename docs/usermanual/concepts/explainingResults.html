    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">All queries executed in Snofyre are transformed into their corresponding intermediate
            forms (SQL form or Java objects) for execution against the test data. Snofyre provides
            the ability to log and retrieve all the individual steps involved in the transformation
            and execution of a query in order to compute the result set that satifies all the
            criteria of the query. This allows the user to understand and verify the validity of the
            mechanisms that Snofyre to report over SNOMED CT encoded data.</p>

        <div class="p">Since every query is composed of one or more query expressions which in turn need to be
            transformed and executed, generation of an explanation for a query involves generating
            the explanation of all the individual expressions that make up the query. Snofyre by
            default logs all the steps involved in transforming and executing all query expressions
            in a query. The steps that are logged in Snofyre are separated into two types; Commented
            Steps and SQL steps.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Explanation of the results of a query execution is generated
                only if the underlying QueryEngine's status is set to DEBUG.</div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Setting the
                    <a class="xref" href="queryExecutionState.html#concept-query-execution-state">Query Execution
                    State</a> of a query expression contained within the query to <em class="ph i"><strong class="ph b">SKIP</strong></em> will result in exclusion of the query expression during query
                execution as well as explanation generation.</div>
</div>

        <div class="section">Commented Steps<p class="p">The steps involved in transformation of a query into its
                intermediate forms (SQL and Java objects) create SQL statements and code that is
                difficult for a normal user to understand. For this reason, Snofyre adds helpful
                comments for each step that explains the nature of the operation being carried out.
                This makes for a more human friendly explanation being generated along with the
                intermediate SQL statements.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section">SQL Steps<div class="p">These are the collection of SQL statements that have been used in the
                transformation and execution of the query against the test data. These statements
                are not intended for viewing by a user without good understanding of RDBMS. It
                should be possible to copy paste the collection of the statements returned for each
                query expression and recreate the intermediate data structures that correspond to
                the query expression.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The ability to export SQL statements and then execute
                    them separately from the Snofyre is important when using <strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">Temporary
                        Tables</em></strong> as the <a class="xref" href="tableCreationStrategy.html#concept-table-creation-strategy">Table Creation Strategy</a>, where the temporary tables are
                    automatically dropped by the database engine when the session/connection is
