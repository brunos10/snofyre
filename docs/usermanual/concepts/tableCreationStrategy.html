    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p" id="concept-table-creation-strategy__definition"><a name="concept-table-creation-strategy__definition"><!-- --></a>Table Creation Strategy refers to the mechanism by which Snofyre stores intermediate
            results that are generated while executing a Query Statement against the database
            backend.</p>

        <div class="p" id="concept-table-creation-strategy__table_creation_strategies_decisions"><a name="concept-table-creation-strategy__table_creation_strategies_decisions"><!-- --></a>Since a Query Statement is often composed of
            more than one sub queries nested within it, Snofyre often needs to compute the result
            set that satisfy the criteria each of the sub queries before it can compute the result
            set that satisfies all the criteria encapsulated within the Query Statement. During
            execution, the result set for each of the sub queries is often calculated and stored as
            either a Table, Temporary Table or View.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Table Creation Strategy might
                have an impact on the performance of a query of the Snofyre especially the time
                required to compute the result set of a given query. In general this is dependant on
                the way in which indices are created and handled within tables, temporary tables and
                views within a particular database engine implementation.<p class="p">Snofyre does not make
                    any assumptions about the most suitable table creation strategy. Instead, the
                    user is expected to choose the most appropriate table creation strategy for
                    their favourite database engine.</p>
</div>
</div>

        <div class="section"><strong class="ph b">Table Creation Strategy Options</strong><p class="p">This section offers an overview of the
                various table creation strategies available in Snofyre. A detailed discussion of the
                distinction between a Table, Temporary Table and View in the Relational Database
                Engine is beyond the scope of this document. The user is referred to any of the
                standard resources available online or to consult the documentation of their
                favourite database engine for more information.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><strong class="ph b">Normal Tables</strong><p class="p" id="concept-table-creation-strategy__normal_table_desc"><a name="concept-table-creation-strategy__normal_table_desc"><!-- --></a>These are also referred to as <em class="ph i">permanent tables</em>. These are the tables that are routinely created by a
                database administrator to store data. These tables have a physical existence and are
                persisted between sessions until they are dropped.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><strong class="ph b">Temporary Tables</strong><p class="p" id="concept-table-creation-strategy__temp_table_desc"><a name="concept-table-creation-strategy__temp_table_desc"><!-- --></a>These are also referred to as <em class="ph i">temp tables</em>. Unlike permanent tables, temporary tables have a short life
                span and are only visible to the user who created them. Temporary tables behave like
                normal tables except that they are not persisted across sessions. If temporary
                tables are not dropped, the database engine removes them automatically at the end of
                a session.</p>
</div>

        <div class="section"><strong class="ph b">Views</strong><div class="p" id="concept-table-creation-strategy__view_desc"><a name="concept-table-creation-strategy__view_desc"><!-- --></a>These are also referred to as derived tables. Unlike
                normal and temporary tables, a view does not store any rows. Instead, it serves as a
                logical view for combining/referring to the data inside a 'base' table (a
                normal/permanent table) like a 'virtual table'. The contents of a view exist only
                when it is used in a statement.<div class="note attention"><span class="attentiontitle">Attention:</span> Views have certain important
                        limitations.<ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">Unlike, the other two types of tables, it is not possible to create an
                            index on a view.</li>

                        <li class="li">In MySQL, only views created with 'merge' algorithm can use indices on
                            the base table.</li>

                        <li class="li">Subqueries cannot be used in the FROM clause of a view.</li>
