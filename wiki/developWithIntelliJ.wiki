This section assumes that you have already checked out Snofyre's source code using the instructions in ... Please read the instructions on this page, especially the note about test failures if you have not already done so. 

== Creating a New Project for Snofyre ==

Since IntelliJ works beautifully with multi-modular projects, please create a separate module for each of Snofyre's four source projects.
{{{
srth-desktop
snomed-osgi
yasb-osgi
srth-osgi
}}}

This guide walks you through creating a new project for one of source projects. For this example, we'll use {{{srth-desktop}}}.

== Getting Started ==
