#summary Downloading Snofyre from TRUD.

= Downloading Snofyre from TRUD =

This section describes the process for downloading Snofyre installer and packaged data from [https://www.uktcregistration.nss.cfh.nhs.uk/ TRUD]. This is currently needed since some of Snofyre's components contain SNOMED CT concepts and also requires a pre-packaged release of SNOMED CT. We are in the process of creating an installer that can be downloaded from the Google Code site which can download the necessary TRUD packs. For the moment, you'll need to download Snofyre's installer and data from TRUD.

== Accessing Snofyre Data & Installer ==

  # Please register with TRUD at https://www.uktcregistration.nss.cfh.nhs.uk/trud/
  #  Please sign up for access to the pack NHSSNOFYRE (and its sub packs) by selecting the packs shown below.
  # [http://snofyre.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/trud-signup.png]
  # Since the current version of Snofyre bundles SNOMED CT content, you'll be asked to accept the IHTSDO and UKTC licenses.
  # When you have been granted access to the pack (usually an overnight process), download the following following release:
    * If you are on Windows : NHSSNOFYRE/1.1.0/NHS_SNOFYREINST/nhs_snofyreinst_1.1.0_20110101000001.zip
    * If you are on any other operating system : NHSSNOFYRE/1.1.0/NHS_SNOFYREINSTOTHEROS/nhs_snofyreinstotheros_1.1.0_20110101000001.zip
  # When you have downloaded the release file, unzip to a folder of your choice.
  # You can run the installer that you've downloaded to install Snofyre.
  # The installer will walk you through the process of getting Snofyre up and running. Please refer to the [http://snofyre.googlecode.com/files/snofyre-installation-manual.pdf installation manual] for instructions.
