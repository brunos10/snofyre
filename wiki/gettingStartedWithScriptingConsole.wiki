#summary Getting started with Snofyre's Scripting Console

= Getting started with Snofyre's Scripting Console =

Traditionally developers and advanced users have had to use an IDE and follow the following steps to start using APIs. We've tried to make it easier to access Snofyre's API for advanced users and developers by providing a console based access to Snofyre's underlying services. 

So the following steps that you'd expect to follow to create a {{{Hello World}}} example, are not necessary for Snofyre:

  * ~~Install Maven~~
  * ~~Install Mercurial~~
  * ~~Check out Snofyre Code from the Snofyre Repo~~
  * ~~Compile using mvn clean install~~
  * ~~Now create a class {{{Hello Services}}}~~
  * ~~Import {{{uk.nhs.cfh.dsp.snomed.dao.TerminologyService}}}~~
  * ~~So and so forthâ€¦~~
