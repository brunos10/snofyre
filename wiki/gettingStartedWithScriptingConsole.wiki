#summary Getting started with Snofyre's Scripting Console

= Getting started with Snofyre's Scripting Console =

== Starting Snofyre's Scripting Console ==
In order to launch Snofyre's Scripting Console:
  * Select {{{Launch scripting console}}} from under {{{Tools}}} menu.
  * This should launch the scripting console as shown below.

  * You can minimise Snofyre application window while you are working on the scripting console.
  * Remember we said, minimise not *close*!

=== First steps with scripting ===
To get started with scripting Snofyre, lets see how easy it is to create a {{{Hello Snofyre}}} example.
  * Type {{{print "Hello Snofyre"}}} in the scripting console as shown below.
{{{
print "Hello Snofyre"
}}}

  * Now run this code using the {{{Run script}}} button. You should see the following output

  * Remember when we said you have access to all of Java from inside the scripting console? Let's show you how. Lets use Java Swing to recreate a more fancy version of our {{{Hello Snofyre}}} example.
  * Clear the scripting console and type the following code as shown below
{{{
import javax.swing.*
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello Snofyre")
}}}

  * Now run this code using the {{{Run script}}} button
  * This should display a simple (arguably more pretty) {{{Hello Snofyre}}} message on your screen as shown below.

=== Accessing Snofyre's Services ===

One of the most common operations you might perform if you were building a SNOMED CT enabled application is retrieving SNOMED CT content. A typical example of this might be getting the {{{Fully Specified Name}}} for a SNOMED CT concept. Let us show you how easy it is to do this using Snofyre's underlying Services. Snofyre provides a service called {{{TerminologyDAO}}} that offers this functionality out of the box. Let us see how we can use this to retrieve the {{{Fully Specified Name}}} for a SNOMED CT concept with an ID {{{22298006}}}.
  * Clear the scripting console and type the following into the console
{{{
print terminologyDAO.getTerminologyConcept("22298006").getFullySpecifiedName()
}}}
[http://snofyre.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/console-hello-5.png]
  * This should print out the following on in the console output
{{{
Myocardial Infarction (disorder)
}}}
[http://snofyre.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/console-hello-6.png]
  * Yep thats right! We've just looked up the {{{Fully Specified Name}}} for a given {{{concept id}}} in SNOMED CT using a single line of code!

If all of that sounds interesting, then we've just scratched the surface of Snofyre's API. Head over to the [advancedScripting Advanced scripting] section to learn more.
