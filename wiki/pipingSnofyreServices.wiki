#summary Joining up Snofyre's Services.

= Joining up Snofyre's Services =
As the advanced users and Java programmers will already realise, we do not have to declare objects at every step. We can {{{pipe}}} or redirect the output of one Snofyre service as the input of another. So we could have printed the {{{compositional grammar form}}} of {{{Myocardial infarction }}} using the two lines shown below.
{{{
def concept = terminologyDAO.getTerminologyConcept("22298006")
println cgfConverter.getCompositionalForm(normalFormGenerator.getLongNormalFormExpression(concept))
}}}
  * If you already knew that {{{22298006}}} corresponds to {{{Myocardial infarction }}}, or if you didnt care what it corresponds to, you could have use the following *single* line of code to generate the {{{compositional grammar form}}}:
{{{
println cgfConverter.getCompositionalForm(normalFormGenerator.getLongNormalFormExpression(terminologyDAO.getTerminologyConcept("22298006")))
}}}
